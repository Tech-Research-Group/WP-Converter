# WP-Converter

To use this application copy your OneNote data starting with the title of the note all the way through
your follow-on maintenance instructions. Paste the data in the textarea on the left and click the 
"Convert" button. The converted output should come up in the textarea on the right. From here you can
copy the newly generated XML into an existing txt file or choose to save it as a new file. If you find
any bugs or have some ideas to improve the program please reach out to Nick Ricci so he can address them
properly. Thanks!
